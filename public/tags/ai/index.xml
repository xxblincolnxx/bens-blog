      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my new goals for using AI as a development tool is to start trying to use it for more than just enhanced autocomplete, with some important limitations. First, I want to make sure I actually continue to learn as I code. So I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use Copilot as a starting point. Second, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to enter a &amp;ldquo;vibe coding&amp;rdquo; loop, blindly accepting changes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had a good experience with Copilot recently with a self assigned challenge. The goal was to build an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/xxblincolnxx/infinite-scroll&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;implementation of a generic Infinite Scrolling component&lt;/a&gt; or set of hooks/utilities using React and Typescript. Eventually I plan on creating my own components library that I can inject into any of my React projects. This work will probably be a part of that package.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/cad_image.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;CAD&#34;&gt;&#xA;Perspective can be a funny thing… It’s so hard to remember your historical context when you’re “up to your ass in alligators” or “in the thick of it”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being a software engineer or any kind of tech-adjacent specialist has been a little intimidating lately with all of the AI hype. You&amp;rsquo;re probably tired of hearing about it, it&amp;rsquo;s so prevalent. Change like this stirs up anxiety and discontent. For one, there’s a change in the development workflow. We no longer manually write all of our code (or at least we probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t); now it’s &lt;code&gt;prompt =&amp;gt; generate =&amp;gt; review =&amp;gt; tweak =&amp;gt; test =&amp;gt; repeat&lt;/code&gt;. There’s definitely something lost in the process that we fell in love with&amp;hellip; feeling like a wizard flying through tabs and windows without lifting a finger off your keyboard&amp;hellip; achieving &amp;ldquo;flow state&amp;rdquo; when you&amp;rsquo;re just so locked in and know what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to type well before you get there. It&amp;rsquo;s very different now and it feels like it only keeps getting further away from that classic programming flow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
