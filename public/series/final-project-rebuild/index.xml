      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly large section, highlighting the process by which I&amp;rsquo;ve created the starting point for the auth and user registration for the new iteration of my bootcamp final project. I wanted to do my best to follow current best practices and build out a solid starting point for user registration and authentication. A primary reference for this work was this excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/S8Cjx5ua2JU?si=YAPZ5HOr6JTBTEMB&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@mguay&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Michael Guay&lt;/a&gt;. I like how he organizes the NestJS project and his approach seems to follow pretty solid, modern best practices, though these things seem to change all the time. He utilizes MongoDB/mongoose and not Postgres/Drizzle so for my app I had to do a fair bit of customization; couldn&amp;rsquo;t just use his code line by line. I&amp;rsquo;ll outline what I did in this article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Project: Picking my Backend</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’ll talk about the first step I’ve taken towards my new pet project: a total rebuild of my bootcamp final project. My team of 3 completed this project in the span of 2 weeks at the very beginning of the 2020 pandemic… as in, we had been going to classes in person, then we entered quarantine just as we got our team assignments and completed everything remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the time we had only been writing code for 10 weeks. In our toolkit we had only vanilla JS + HTML + CSS for frontend, and Django and Python (notably no SQL) for backend. Our team bravely took on learning parts of Vue.js to help us build our UI. The backend was also a departure from what we knew. We used the Django REST framework so we could fetch our data instead of using the out of box Model-View-Template structure to pass data to our views.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
