So, remember [this]({{< ref "posts/pickingBackEnd.md" >}}) where I talk picking a robust ORM solution? Well, I've begun to draw out my entity relationship diagram (shoutout to [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)) and I am working on the problem of keeping my tables from getting "too wide"-- one of the fundamental weaknesses of typical ORMs. Here are a few of the features of Drizzle that are going to save me:

1. To create many-to-many relationships you actually create a proper join table where things can live. This is important because I will need the join table to contain information unique to each junction. I wouldn't have that kind of granular control over the join table in a regular ORM. The table would be abstracted.
2. I can use Drizzle's query and join methods to create an efficient SQL query, without worrying about over fetching data. [Here's](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/joins) more about that.
3. If the function calls get out of hand, Drizzle has a "[magic SQL](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql)" operator that will allow me to write a regular ol' SQL queries.

So far this has been a good design choice.
