Portfolios are pretty common projects for junior and mid-level frontend engineers. I had one before I got my first engineering job, which you can see in all of its glory, [here](https://benprothe-portfolio.netlify.app/). Let's be co-critical for a moment. Here are the easy things that stick out to the "me" of today:

1. I have 2 projects listed as "coming soon". Spoiler alert - Those projects weren't ever completed :joy:. My first instinct is to say that I got hired, but if I'm being honest with myself I actually abandoned them as concepts before that.
2. There aren't very many quality projects, and the most valuable projects (flashcards and bevdev) were hosted on Heroku Free Tier (RIP), back in the day, so the links don't go anywhere.
3. The portfolio itself is overengineered. It's a one-view React app that solves a very, very, very solved problem. Content management systems have existed for a long time. Back then, my goal in using React was to demonstrate that I could... use React. So I wasn't thinking like a professional problem solver, I was thinking like a student. I even put the portfolio itself in the list of projects :joy:.

One of the things I want to accomplish with this blog is to add narrative to my growth and discovery as a developer. Looking critically at my old work is part of that goal.
