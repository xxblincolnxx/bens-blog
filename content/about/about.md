{{< tab tabName="About" >}}

  <p>I love to code! I love the options, agency, and creativity made accessible through writing code. My favorite technologies are all related to JavaScript and its diverse ecosystems but I love to learn new technologies. I've also heavily used Python + Django and Java + Spring and SQL, galore. But I don't view those technologies as constraints, by any means. I want to find the best tools to solve the problems I am working on. So, it serves to not wed one's self to what they already know.</p>
  <p>
   In my private life I love fishing, drawing, music, writing, reading, and playing darts. Most of all, I love my family! My wife and I have a little daughter (who shall remain unidentified) in gradeschool. The two ladies in my life are the apple of my eye!</p>

  <p>I'll probably choose to expand this section a bit once I get this thing rolling.</p>
